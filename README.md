SierraChart is a very high performance trading platform written in C++ and it can be downloaded here (account needed):

> www.sierrachart.com

SierraChart gives delayed <b>tick by tick</b> price datafeed including the <b>Depth of the Market</b> for CME Group of exchanges (CME, CBOT, COMEX, and NYMEX) and the EUREX and it comes shipped like a 64 bit Windows application. CME is delayed by 10 minutes and 10 seconds while the EUREX is delayed by 15 minutes.

To do predictions and analysis having the correct and <b>reliable</b> data is crucial and SierraChart datafeed just gets it more than right !

SierraChart C++ codes need to be <i>compiled</i> as DLL files and they are supposed to be saved into <b>C:/YOUR_PATH_TO_SIERRACHART/SierraChart/Data/</b> folder.
In order to get SierraCharta C++ code to work, please follow these instructions on Windows or Mac.

# SierraChart C++ code compilation on Mac OSX

<b>1.</b> Install <i>Homebrew</i> on you Mac to manage packages by opening the OSX terminal and typing:
> <b> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" </b>

<b>2.</b> Once installed Homebrew, please install <i>Mingw</i> which compiles C++ code for Windows by opening the OSX terminal and typing:
> brew install mingw-w64

<b>3.</b> Once  Mingw compiler is installed correctly, put all SierraCharts files contained into <b>C:/YOUR_PATH_TO_SIERRACHART/SierraChart/Data/ACS_Source</b> and your C++ custom study file into same folder.

<b>4.</b> Now, run OSX terminal <b>from</b> the folder you just created at point three and execute the following compiling instructions (check your latest Mingw compiler version):
> /usr/local/Cellar/mingw-w64/6.0.0_2/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -O2 -shared -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -s -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions -w MY_STUDY_NAME_HERE.cpp -o MY_STUDY_NAME_HERE.dll

On your Mac, you will have your DLL file compiled properly to run on Windows version of SierraChart.

# SierraChart C++ code compilation on Windows

Compile SierraChart DLL code on Windows could be done in different ways.
The best solution, both for DLL compilation and indicator creation, is to install VisualStudio Community edition that can be downloaded here:

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/it/downloads/

Once VisualStudio "monster" installation finishes <b>- with all C++ plugins and additions -</b>, you can compile your first DLL indicator or strategies like I have showed in this video:
